Notes.
i did not understand the need and use for github commentations and discussions, as it was not a group task, so I did not include that, i also was not able yo get any of the bonus features to work without extensive help from online tools, so I decided it was best to remove those features entirely. in the end i kept only the basic features as to not complicate it for myself and allow it to atleast be easier to understand for you. I did ask for peer review on my code to help me correct a few mistakes, such as spelling errors and places in which my JavaScript code was bugged.
